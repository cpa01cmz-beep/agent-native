/**
 * Keep explanatory chrome off the default surface.
 *
 * "The UI has too much text" is the most repeated correction in this repo
 * (`text-heavy-ui` in scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs, 79 in the two weeks to
 * 2026-08-12 — the largest row in that table). Three prose rewrites of the same
 * rule failed to move it, so this is the mechanism half: the shapes below are
 * the ones the user has asked to have deleted by name, more than once.
 *
 * Scope note. This is a habit, not a backlog: the repo already renders hundreds
 * of legitimate muted paragraphs, and a guard that fails on all of them is a
 * guard someone turns off. So it checks only lines this branch ADDED. The tenth
 * instance cannot ship while the first nine stay a separate, schedulable
 * cleanup.
 *
 * What it deliberately cannot see: whether a sentence you wrote earns its place.
 * These four detectors cover structure only. The judgment half lives in
 * `.agents/skills/frontend-design` → Default Surface Density, and pretending
 * otherwise would make a green run read as "the surface is clean" when it only
 * means "no new instance of four known shapes".
