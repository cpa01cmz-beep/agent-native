 * Fail a deploy whose serverless functions grew past their recorded size.
 *
 * The existing budget (`netlifyFunctionSizeBudget`, build.ts) is a single
 * 120MB ceiling plus allowances. It has never fired, because it was set above
 * the fleet's worst app and every app sat under it while quietly doubling —
 * docs went 59.8MB to 159.9MB inside that headroom. A ceiling nobody is near
 * measures nothing; growth from where an app actually is, does.
 *
 * This compares each emitted function against a committed per-app baseline and
 * fails on growth beyond the tolerance. An app with no baseline fails too: a
 * deploy nothing has measured is unmeasured, not small, and letting it exit 0
 * would rebuild the same "everything passes" signal this replaces. The only
 * apps allowed through unmeasured are the ones named in UNMEASURABLE_APPS, so
 * every gap is a line in the diff a reviewer can see.

/**
 * Payloads whose presence is decided by the deploy environment rather than by

 * names an architecture matching the serverless target (`build.ts`,
 * `shouldBundleFfmpegStaticForServerless`). Production sets it, beta does not,
 * and the gap is ~76MB per emitted function.
 *
 * One baseline map serves both contexts, so whichever context recorded it last
 * decides what the other is measured against, and it fails in both directions:
 *
 *   - Recorded on beta, checked on production: clips read 112.6MB against a
 *     36.1MB baseline. Every production promotion of the media apps failed on
 *     a 76MB "regression" that was the same binary both builds intended, and
 *     clips served a stale build for two days because of it.
 *   - Recorded on production, checked on beta: the inverse, and worse, because
 *     it fails open — beta can absorb a real 76MB regression unnoticed.
 *
 * Printing the split does not fix that. It makes an otherwise inexplicable
 * ±76MB swing legible at the moment someone hits it, which is the part that
 * cost two days. Subtracting it here would NOT be safe while the committed
 * baselines are a mix of both units: a build measured after subtraction and
 * compared against a payload-inclusive baseline silently passes anything under
 * the payload's own size. Making the metric context-independent means
 * recording every baseline in one unit — a change to the baseline format, not
