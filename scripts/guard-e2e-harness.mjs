/**
 * guard-e2e-harness.mjs
 *
 * Hygiene for the shared E2E harness, learned from a sweep where 63 Design
 * specs were red and most causes were harness drift rather than product bugs:
 *
 *   - `responsive-overview-regressions.spec.ts` defaulted to 127.0.0.1:9340
 *     while the config serves 9333. All four of its tests failed in ~50ms
 *     against a dead port, in CI, for eight weeks. Every spec that repeats a
 *     port literal is one rename away from the same silence.
 *   - Six specs grew their own `openEditor`, each waiting on slightly
 *     different chrome, so the same product change broke them unevenly.
 *   - `designFrame(page)` resolves `.last()`. Once a fixture mounts a second
 *     screen, ~17 assertions silently read the wrong document.
 *   - Six specs hand-rolled `.click().catch(() => {})` to "optionally" expand
 *     the layers tree. A click on a locator that matches nothing waits out the
 *     full 15s actionTimeout and, once caught, is indistinguishable from a
 *     successful click. That one idiom cost 30s per drag-and-drop test —
 *     42s -> 11.5s once bounded.
 *
 * Scope: lines ADDED on this branch only, so the existing backlog stays a
 * separate cleanup and this just stops the regrowth. Opt out with an inline
 * `e2e-harness-ignore` comment and say why.
