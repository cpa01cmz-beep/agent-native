/**
 * Quarantine budget for the Design E2E suite.
 *
 * A `test.fixme` is a bug someone chose not to fix yet. That is legitimate —
 * once. What is not legitimate is the count drifting upward unnoticed: this
 * suite ran post-merge only for weeks, and 63 specs rotted because nothing
 * could fail a pull request. Two rules, both mechanical:
 *
 *   1. The count never grows without the ceiling moving in the same diff, so
 *      a reviewer sees the trade.
 *   2. Every quarantined test carries a `//` reason directly above it. A
 *      parked test with no symptom recorded is indistinguishable from a test
 *      someone silenced to get a green run.
 *
 * Lower CEILING whenever the real count drops — that is the whole point.

 * counted among the suite's totals. Two were doing exactly that — a Scale
