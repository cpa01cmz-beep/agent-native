/**
 * Shared stream deadlines for model-request engines.
 *
 * Two bounds, both keyed off facts the transport can actually establish:
 *
 *  - FIRST: a request that connects and then streams zero events means the
 *    transport or gateway is wedged, not slow — real models (including deep
 *    thinking ones) emit their first event within seconds.
 *  - TOTAL: the whole request, first event or not, cannot outlive the largest
 *    budget any caller runs inside.
 *
 * AUDIENCE: every `engine.stream()` caller, `runAgentLoop` INCLUDED. The first
 * bound used to be described as shadowed inside the loop by a 90s in-loop
 * watchdog that "always wins"; that watchdog is gone (see
 * run-lifecycle-invariants.ts), so these are now the PRIMARY bounds on a model
 * call that wedges. They survive that deletion because neither infers death
 * from the ABSENCE of a particular event mid-generation — the fact the removed
 * watchdogs got wrong, since the Anthropic SDK drops the provider's `ping`
 * keepalives before any consumer sees them. Do not "clean them up" as
 * redundant, and do not add a no-progress bound back beside them.

 * by its own chunk long before this. It exists for the runtimes that have no
 * outer budget at all — local dev and self-hosted resolve the soft timeout to
 * `0`, so without this a socket that wedges AFTER the first frame leaves the
