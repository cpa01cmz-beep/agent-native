/**
 * Wraps `runAgentLoop` with two layered recovery mechanisms so a single hosted
 * invocation can survive interruptions without showing the user a dead chat:
 *
 * 1. **Soft timeout** — an inner timer that aborts the LLM call before the
 *    hosting function's hard limit (Lambda 75s, Vercel 60s, etc.) so we have a
 *    chance to gracefully wind down and append a continuation nudge. Without
 *    this the function gets killed mid-stream and the user sees a frozen
 *    spinner.
 *
 * 2. **Resumable-error continuation** — when the LLM call errors with a
 *    transport- or gateway-level interruption (Builder gateway 45s timeout,
 *    socket hang up, ECONNRESET, upstream 5xx that survived engine retries),
 *    we save the conversation prefix, append a "continue from where you left
 *    off" message, and run another LLM call. Anthropic's prompt cache makes
 *    the resume call dramatically faster than the cold first attempt, and the
 *    agent gets explicit context that it was cut off so it doesn't re-do
 *    completed work.
 *
 * Both paths route through `appendAgentLoopContinuation` so the agent sees a
 * uniform "continue" instruction regardless of which recovery fired.
