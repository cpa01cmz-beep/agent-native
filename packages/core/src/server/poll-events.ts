/**
 * Stream in-process poll events over SSE.
 *
 * This is the fast path for agent/tool/action writes that happen in the same
 * server process. The regular /poll endpoint remains the cross-process and
 * serverless cold-start fallback because it can detect DB timestamp changes
 * even when the write happened somewhere this EventEmitter could not see.
 *
 * Also forwards awareness change events (cursor/presence updates) so
 * connected peers receive cursor moves push-style instead of waiting for
 * the next poll cycle. Polling fallback keeps working — cursors degrade
 * gracefully to poll cadence without SSE.
 *
 * `state` defaults to the process-wide instance so self-hosted apps are
 * unchanged; the hosted gateway passes a per-app instance to fan out that
 * app's events (awareness stays on the process-global emitter and is a v0
 * gateway Non-Goal).
 *
 * `maxDurationMs` closes the stream cleanly after that long. The stream is
 * otherwise unbounded, which is right for a long-lived host and wrong for a
 * serverless one: the platform kills the invocation at its own ceiling and
 * records it as a failure, so a single open tab turns into a steady drip of
 * runtime-timeout errors that mask real ones. Closing first ends the response
 * at 200; EventSource reconnects exactly as it does after a platform kill, and
 * `/poll` replays the gap from the cursor, so no event is lost either way.
 * Default: unset (no cap), preserving today's behavior everywhere.
