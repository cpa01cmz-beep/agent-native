/**
 * Tracks the window between starting an MCP OAuth authorization and observing
 * its result, so the shared `["mcp-servers"]` list can be revalidated when the
 * user comes back.
 *
 * The OAuth callback redirects the *popup* to the app return URL and never
 * touches the opener, so without this marker the opener keeps rendering the
 * pre-authorization list forever: every consumer of `useMcpServers()` shows
 * "Connect" for an integration that is already connected. React Query's
 * `refetchOnWindowFocus` is deliberately off across this repo, so the refresh
 * has to be bounded and explicit rather than global.
 *
 * The in-memory marker is authoritative for this tab; sessionStorage only
 * extends it across a reload. A storage failure therefore degrades the window
 * to memory-only, which is never worse than not having the marker at all.
