/**
 * Drizzle schema for the transactional email send log.
 *
 * One row per `sendEmail` attempt, written by the transport itself so every
 * send is recorded regardless of which app or code path triggered it. This is
 * the durable record of "did we send it": the provider's own activity feed ages
 * out (SendGrid keeps 3 days without the extended-retention add-on), so send
 * counts and last-sent must not depend on it.
 *
 * Engagement (opens, clicks, bounces) is deliberately NOT stored here. Only the
 * provider knows it, and mirroring it would go stale the moment a recipient
 * opens an old message. Dispatch reads engagement live from the provider and
 * joins on `template_id`.
