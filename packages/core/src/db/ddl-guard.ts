/**
 * Guards for on-demand `ensureTable()` DDL so the common already-migrated path
 * takes NO `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on Postgres.
 *
 * Lives in its own module (like `./widen-columns.js`) so stores can import it
 * without every `vi.mock("../db/client.js")` test needing to stub it.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `ensureTable()` runs once per process on first DB touch. In a long-lived Node
 * server the cost is paid once and is invisible. In a Netlify `-background`
 * function the process is fresh, so this is the FIRST touch — and the
 * `CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` DDL it issues takes an
 * `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the shared Neon Postgres database. Behind a
 * concurrent connection that already holds a conflicting lock, that DDL can
 * block ~indefinitely (observed >16s hangs in the bg worker vs ~1s inline).
 *
 * The tables/columns are essentially always already present in production, so
 * the DDL is redundant in the hot path. These helpers let a store cheaply check
 * `information_schema` first and only issue DDL when something is actually
 * missing — and when DDL must run, wrap it in a short `lock_timeout` so a
 * contended lock fails fast instead of hanging.
 *
 * All checks and DDL in this module use Postgres system catalogs.
