# Ship

Use /ship only when the user asks to ship, publish, or hand off the current
work. It means: publish the requested current-branch snapshot, open a ready
PR, monitor it, merge it when the gates hold, and leave the worktree ready for
the next task.

## Contract

- Ship all nonignored changes belonging to the requested work on the current
  branch. The checkpoint helper excludes learnings.md, bridge/**, and data/**.
- Preserve unrelated or incomplete concurrent work. Never reset, clean, stash,
  overwrite, rebase, or force-push it.
- /ship authorizes the merge once the gates below pass, unless the user says
  not to merge.
- Use the current worktree and branch. A detached worktree may create one
  unused shipping branch during this flow; never attach or move another
  worktree.
- Never add Co-Authored-By, codex, [codex], or agent labels to commits, branch
  names, PR titles, or PR bodies.

## Flow

1. Preflight the worktree and ownership.
2. Run focused validation and publish the first coherent snapshot.
3. Open or update the ready PR immediately.
4. Run /babysit-pr <number> and keep the watcher or foreground loop active.
5. Merge only after the live gates hold continuously for 10 minutes.
6. Verify the merge reached origin/main, then rotate to a fresh branch.
7. Report source checks, PR, merge, branch rotation, and deployment boundaries
   separately.

## 1. Preflight

Start by refreshing the remote and reading the actual checkout:

```bash
if ! git fetch origin --quiet; then
  echo "Cannot refresh origin refs; stop before checking unpublished commits." >&2
  exit 1
fi
git status --short
git diff --stat
git log --oneline -5
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
```

The all-origin fetch refreshes both `origin/main` and the current branch's
tracking ref before comparing unpublished work. Inspect the current branch's
unpushed commits with the remote-aware fallback:

```bash
if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$(git branch --show-current)"; then
  git log --oneline "origin/$(git branch --show-current)"..HEAD -- \
    ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**' ':(exclude)data/**'
else
  git log --oneline HEAD --not --remotes=origin -- \
    ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**' ':(exclude)data/**'
fi
```

The behind count is information, not a reason to merge or rebase. Check
GitHub's live mergeability before updating from origin/main.

If git branch --show-current is empty, inspect git worktree list --porcelain
and existing changes-\* refs, then create an unused shipping branch in this
worktree only. Never use main, attach a branch checked out elsewhere, or move
another worktree. This branch creation is authorized by the explicit /ship
request.

Before publishing, classify every dirty path and unpushed commit. If any is
unrelated or incomplete concurrent work, preserve it and stop the publishing
step with a concrete report. Do not hide it in a stash or make a guessed
commit.

## 2. Validate and publish

Run the smallest relevant formatter, tests, typecheck, and guards for the
changed area. Push the first coherent snapshot before a long prep or broad
validation so CI can work in parallel. A slow or contaminated local check is
not permission to stall the handoff; record the exact result and let the PR
checks carry the gate.

After the ownership check, run:

```bash
corepack pnpm ship:push
```

Confirm the push landed on the current branch and read the remote head back.
Run ship:push again only for an actionable CI fix, review fix, conflict
resolution, or explicit user request. A clean tree, a behind count, queued
checks, or a babysit timer never creates a publish commit.

## 3. Open or update the PR

Open or update one ready PR for the current branch immediately after the first
push. Use a factual title and body. Do not create a second PR from a worktree.
Do not tag, assign, mention, or leave proactive comments on the PR unless the
user explicitly requested that communication. A factual reply needed to
document a review fix or terminal disposition is allowed when the babysit
gate requires it.

Keep these claims separate in the PR and final report:

- source and focused tests;
- CI and review state;
- merged commit and origin/main ancestry;
- beta, docs, or production deployment state.

## 4. Babysit

Run /babysit-pr <number> immediately after PR creation and follow that skill
for the durable heartbeat, serialized PR lease, local-change ownership checks,
review handling, conflict recovery, and cadence. Do not duplicate its lease
protocol here or end the task after opening the PR without either its watcher
or a foreground loop.

If a live PR is CONFLICTING, let babysit-pr recover it only after:

- the local tree and publishable-path unpublished-commit check are clean;
- the local HEAD exactly matches the live PR headRefOid;
- origin/main was freshly fetched.

Merge origin/main once with a normal merge, resolve and test it, push, and
restart the soak. Never merge main merely because the PR is behind, checks are
pending, or mergeability is UNKNOWN.

### Feedback handoff

If /review-latest-feedback was used, carry its start cursor, grouped reports,
evidence links, and disposition table into the ship ledger and PR recap.
Follow review-latest-feedback for ownership, reactions, reporter replies, and
the exact disposition vocabulary; follow babysit-pr for review comments and
merge blocking. Do not send Slack replies or reactions as a routine ship step
unless that workflow was explicitly requested or already owns the action.

Leave bot-authored PRs, including Dependabot, untouched when reviewing a queue.

## 5. Merge gate

Merge only when all of these are true at the same time and remain true for 10
continuous minutes on the unchanged live PR head:

- working tree is clean and there are no unpushed commits;
- required GitHub Actions checks are green;
- every human or bot review item has a verified fix/reply or a valid terminal
  disposition;
- GitHub reports the PR mergeable;
- no new actionable feedback arrived during the soak.

Then use the explicit squash-admin merge:

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --squash --admin
```

Never enable auto-merge. If a gate fails, fix the actionable cause, publish one
coherent update to the same PR, and restart the soak. A queued, skipped,
cancelled, superseded, provider, or missing-secret job is not automatically a
repo defect; classify it before changing code.

## 6. Rotate after merge

After the merge, verify that origin/main contains the merge commit. Then run
the post-ship branch rotation owned by /new-branch, preserving and reporting
any pre-existing stashes. The final state is a fresh branch from current
origin/main, not a detached merged checkout.

## Deployment boundary

Merges trigger the prebuilt beta publisher on every push to `main`. The docs
production workflow runs only when its path filters match. Other production
promotion is manual. Do not wait for Netlify Git-connected builds, clear a
Netlify lock by hand, or claim beta or production is live from a green PR. Use
/ship-and-monitor when the user asks for post-merge beta, docs, release-tail,
or manual-production proof.

## Final report

Include the ready PR URL, merged commit, fresh branch, focused/local checks,
required CI state, feedback dispositions, and any deployment result. Say
explicitly when deployment was not part of this run.
