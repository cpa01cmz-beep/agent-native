/**
 * Aggregate analytics for a recording.
 *
 * Owner-only — uses assertAccess at editor level (owners always satisfy).
 *
 * Returns: views (total counted human view sessions, so a returning viewer
 * counts again), agentViews (outside agents reading the clip's agent APIs),
 * uniqueViewers (distinct people behind those views), completionRate,
 * dropOff (100 buckets), ctaConversionRate.
 *
 * completionRate and ctaConversionRate are null — never 0 — when no human
 * viewer has been counted yet, so an agent-only clip does not read as 0%.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm action get-recording-insights --recordingId=<id>
