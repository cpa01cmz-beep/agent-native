//! wherever their window sits, so detection survives joining a call and then
//! working in another app — the common case that foreground dwell alone missed
//! entirely. Foreground dwell remains the fallback for machines whose OS cannot
//! report input state at all. On a yes, creates a meeting row via
//! `create-meeting` (matched to a calendar event when one lines up) and shows

//! Reuses `MeetingsWatcherState` session (server URL + cookie + auth token)
