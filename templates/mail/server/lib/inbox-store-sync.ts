 * One call site for "a mutation changed Gmail labels, keep the synced inbox
 * store and the list cache in step." Called from `email-state.ts` (the
 * single-item path every mutation action routes through) and from each
 * action's bulk `gmailBatchModifyByAccount` fan-out, since that helper lives
 * in `google-auth.ts` (owned elsewhere) and can't call back into the store.
 *
 * Best-effort: a store row that doesn't exist yet (e.g. a thread synced
 * after this call started) is silently skipped by `applyLocalLabelDelta`,
 * and the next `ensureInboxFresh` / push notification reconciles it — this
 * is an optimistic local patch, not the source of truth.

 * round-trip per message.
 *
 * Every target must already carry the resolved `accountEmail` that the Gmail
 * mutation actually used — see `resolveMutationAccounts` in email-state.ts,
 * which every caller runs before both the Gmail call and this mirror so the
 * two never group by different rules. A target with no resolved account is
 * dropped rather than guessed at (no owner-email fallback): this is a
